Earth System Modelling
=======================

The Jupyter book supports the handout and lecture notes for Earth System modelling.  Some notebooks are taken (with permission) straight from from Brian Rose's excellent online climate modelling course, and some I have created myself, either from scratch, or using material from various sources/people whom I have always tried to attribute correctly at the start/end of each book.
