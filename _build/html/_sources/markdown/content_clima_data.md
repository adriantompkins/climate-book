Climate data analysis
============================

This is the second term course outlining various techniques in climate data analysis.  In each module, I attempt to introduce a simple concept, building routines and functions to carry out a simple analysis.  This is then usually applied to a real-world problem in climate sciences. Finally, in many cases a package already exists for the process or analysis in question in python and so this is introduced and compared to the "manual" code to ensure the results are the same (they are not always!!!)
