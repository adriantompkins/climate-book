# Atmospheric Physics and Data Analysis

This is my attempt at an online Jupyter-notebook to support the three courses I (sometimes) teach with some hands-on modules, namely Atmospheric Thermodynamics and Physics (TPA), Climate Data analysis (CDA) and Earth System Modelling and Climate Change.  It is a bit of a mixed bag as the modules support various courses and there are syllabus gaps, it is not intended as a stand-alone read.

I should acknowledge that some of the earlier TPA notebooks have been forked from Brian Rose's excellent online book (with permisssion!) and also need climlab to be installed.  Other later modules on climate sensitivity and EOFs are adapted from material I received from various colleagues, each (hopefully!) attributed in the notebook in question.  The remaining notebooks I wrote myself from scratch - please do not hesitate to let me know if you find errors or have suggestions: tompkins@ictp.it
